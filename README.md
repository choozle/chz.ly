### Goal: Design a URL Shortening service for Choozle

### Pairing Agenda 🍐

- prep (candidate)
    - [install tuple](https://tuple.app/) (if you are on linux download zoom and let your facilitator a heads up! 🐧) 
    - [install go]([https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install))
    - `git clone https://github.com/choozle/chz.ly`
- prep (facilitator)
    - send tuple invite
    - [go over requirements together]([https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2ygV4E81AR](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2ygV4E81AR)) and explain the general concept of URL shortening. See [https://bitly.com/](https://bitly.com/) for example.
    - allow for about an hour to complete the exercise + prep time

### Guidance 🍵

- it's 💯 ok to google stuff
- find a comfortable place to work from 🛋️
- use the resources section below as needed
- you are welcomed to use any dependencies that make sense for the time allowed, [except for those that directly solve the problem at hand](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/api/urlshortener/v1)
- the point is not to finish but to try to explore as many ideas as possible 🌎
